    <p>
        Please, read it carefully!
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to flip a coin 6 times in a row.
        You can take your own coin or follow the link on the next page
        that will display a number of online coin-toss generators and chose any.
        All of these generators are totally external to the game, so the created sequence
        will be neither stored nor available for the experimenters.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the syllables of our course, you can find that 10% of the final grade are devoted to class activities. So,
    </p>
    <p>
        - if you get 6 'heads' in a row, you will get 5% out of 10% in class activities instantly after the experiment;
    </p>
    <p>
        - if you get 5 'heads' in a row, you will get 2% out of 10% in class activities instantly after the experiment;
    </p>
    <p>
        - in all other cases you will get nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mind, it is prohibited to lie to the participants in Experimental Economics, so all claims will be fulfilled!
    </p>
    <p>
        To prove your results just make a screenshot of the 'Results' page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Good luck!
