    <p>
        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this study, one of you will be Participant 1 and the other
        Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
        which will be assigned according to a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shock is represented by a change in a Bitcoin value denoted USA Dollars.
        At some time you will be forwarded to a page where you can see
        Bitcoin value changing in real time. At [time] the value will be taken
        as a benchmark: if the last digit in Bitcoin value is odd
        Participant 1 will have an endowment {{ Constants.endowment }}
        and Participant 2 will have an endowment equals to 0.
