# Dice Team Game Under Minimal Paradigm Group
Fischbacher &amp; Föllmi-Heusi Games under Minimal Paradigm Group


Abstract
=========================================================================================================

Published by Tajfel (1970) a paper on group discrimination has yield a great number of further researches. However, the preferences for truth-telling were not under investigation in the laboratory. Nor were the beliefs of the subjects from the same and from the different groups about lying of each other tested explicitly.

Partially building on Conrads et al. (2013) we use one of their treatments as our Baseline introducing minimal paradigm group effect. Our study questions whether lying is stronger when subjects belong to the same characteristics group and whether it is less when they belong to the different characteristics groups comparing to Baseline treatment. 

Firstly, subjects will be asked for the two artists preferences and hence formed in a group (either Monet or Renoir). Secondly, the dice game (Fischbacher \& Föllmi-Heus, 2013) will be carried in a group in two combinations: two subjects from the same group will be matched (Monet-to-Monet treatment) and a subject from Monet group matched with a subject from Renoir (Monet-to-Renoir treatment).
