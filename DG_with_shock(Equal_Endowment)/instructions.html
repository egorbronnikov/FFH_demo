        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this study, one of you will be Participant 1 and the other
        Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
        which will be assigned according to a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shock is represented by a change in a Bitcoin value denoted USA Dollars.
        At some time you will be forwarded to a page where you can see
        Bitcoin value changing in real time. At [time] the value will be taken
        as a benchmark: if the last digit in Bitcoin value is odd
        Participant 1 will be hit by a shock,
        if the last digit in Bitcoin value is even,  Participant 2 will be hit by a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the game both Participant 1 and Participant 2 has
        {{ Constants.endowment }} each. After the shock is realised,
        Participant who is hit by a shock looses his/her endowment and the other participant
        has to decide how much he/she will retain. Then the rest will go to
        Participant 2.
